What We Intend to Solve (The Problem):

Consumers in Zamfara State face challenges in:

Accessing up-to-date information about commodity prices across different local governments.

Making informed purchasing decisions due to inconsistent or unavailable pricing data.

Falling victim to price exploitation or paying more than necessary because of lack of price transparency.


This lack of information affects market fairness and limits consumer empowerment.
